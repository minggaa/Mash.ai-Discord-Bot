# Setup

If you wish to run this bot locally make sure to follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to fulfil each requirement or else your Mash would not be working as intended.

- Have some type of `IDE` or `code editor` installed. (VS Code is a great one)
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed (*Version 21.6.0 and above*)
- **`Clone` (Recommended) or `Download` this repository into your system.**
- Have a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account to use its [Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Have an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/apps) account to use its [Developer portal](https://openai.com/api/).
- Have a [Replicate.ai](https://replicate.com/) account.

## Step 1: Create Discord Bot: Mash

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications > create a `New Application`.
2. Give your bot a name (make sure its 'Mash') and agree to the T&C.
3. Go to `Bot` > Token > and `Reset Token` to get the application token for your new Mash boy.

5. Make sure to turn MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT `ON`.
6. Go to `OAuth2` > `OAuth2 URL Generator` > Select the `bot` and `applications.commands` options > Then configure all the necessary permissions for your Mash (You can set `Administrator` to allow all permissions).
7. Finally, invite your Mash to your server by copying the generated URL and enter through your browser.

## Step 2: Create OpenAI API Key

1. Go to your OpenAI Dashboard and `+ Create a new secret key` under [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Copy the key and store it in the `.env` file under `OPENAI_KEY`.

    <sub>*Refer to [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) if you haven't already made an OpenAI account.*</sub>

## Step 3: Create Replicate.ai API Token

1. Go to [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) > Click on your profile name (on the top left) > `API Tokens` > Give your token a name then `Create Token`.
2. Copy the key and store it in the `.env` file under `REPLICATE_API_KEY`.

    <sub>*Refer to [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) if you haven't already made a Replicate account.*</sub>

## Step 4: Setup Project Environment

1. Open your `terminal`.
2. Navigate to the cloned/downloaded project directory: `cd [directory]`.
3. Run `npm ci`<sup>[?](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-ci)</sup> to install all necessary dependencies.
4. Make sure all the necessary API/Token keys are correct and stored in your `.env` file, or else you wouldn't be able to use Mash's features.
5. Run `node deploy-commands.js` to deploy and/or update the Mash's commands to discord.
6. Now you're ready to run your very own **Mash** (bot) using:
    - **Default**: `npm start` or `node src/index.js`
    - **Nodemon**: `npm run server`

    <sub>*To end a running execution use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code>, or you can just end the terminal too.*</sub>
